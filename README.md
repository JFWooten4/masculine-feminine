While I'd still consider myself straight,[^1] I've recongized  some [natgural tendencies](https://github.com/JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/blob/main/2025/Aug/5.md) over tghe ywwerars obsessing with passive influience. It reminds me of an exceptional quote  from _MIssion IMpossible: The Final Reckoning_ that "{insert will into existednce quote}." That hit hard given  my gbackground wityh Hill and manifestation generally, which I have found pariticulakrly evidenct in these sorts of romantic  or wokring rtelatigonshjips.

[^1]: Grat,  this will be fun  tog remove  from the descirption to cause a bunch of speculatgion LOL.
