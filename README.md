### Love is a weapon, so use it like one.

While I'd still consider myself straight,[^1] I've recognized some [natural tendencies](https://github.com/JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/blob/main/2025/Aug/5.md) over the years obsessing with passive influence. It reminds me of an exceptional quote from _Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning_ that “any hope for a better future comes from willing that future into being, a future reflecting the measure of good within ourselves.” That hit hard given my background with Hill and manifestation generally, which I have found particularly evident in these sorts of romantic or working relationships.

[^1]: Great, this will be fun to remove from the description to cause a bunch of speculation LOL.
