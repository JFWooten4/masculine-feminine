> what's the point of having two people work when one of them is a billionaire

> That's one thing I absolutely love about K... provably not engrossed in monetary interests, as can so commonly corrupt the bonds between a man and a woman.

> That's one thing I absolutely love about K, that I know it by and large will be the only relationship I enjoy which is provably not engrossed in monetary interests, as can so commonly corrupt the bonds between a man and a woman. The lack of marriage from Musk rings true to these observations on a surface level. I just know that right now I need stability in quite a few ways, as I've enjoyed for years from her, and ideally that can continue transforming me into my most productive self at any ego-indulgent cost.

> God it was so lonely sleeping by myself. I realized that the only reason I used to get up at 4am was because I had to bend my life around the will of other people.

> She was sooooo much more feminine back then

> But now she's supporting them financially. And that's fucking unacceptable in my book. It's about as bad as me living at home with my mom.

> I feel quite clouded when I can't express this side of me.

> happily together

You can see things start to get pretty bad around JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Aug/8.md


> finally feel like I'm on the other side

> I have found my heart and soul again

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Dec/3.md


> I always thought there'd be this big and fast glow up to skyrocket me to the 7 billion, and that's just not the case.

> if we take this slower longer view, my support system outside work becomes much more important.

> I do deserve color and perfection realized by attaining what I want most in my heart.
(she was great but...)

> I've had the fortune of examining every dark crevasse previously hidden away under a decade of masking. It's not worth living that life anymore

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Dec/5.md


>  in the past I just have never really set boundaries before. I've never had to. I was sort of like a kid that just ate anything and that's exactly how it was growing up. I just ate every single piece of food available until I learned about calories in the ninth grade health class, and then you know I started caring about my health and realizing I didn't even, I mean it sounds silly, but I didn't even realize what you ate affected your body, which was the only way that I could really see my health because I was so big, and then I started, you know, I didn't eat sugar for half a year and I just focused on healthy food, a lot of spinach, a lot of meat, and it changed my life. Completely changed my life. Well now I'm sort of doing that with boundaries. I think I've probably set the first real boundary ever

> I got pretty stressed and pressured during some of the coding just because right now the coding is a little bit of a remnant of me doing a lot of things to be politically savvy and now that I've shaved away the relationship I'm also shaving those aspects away. I don't have to perform as much for the commission.

> I've been able to start talking to people again and I'm doing a very good job at it because everything is not being drained into this pit so to speak, and it feels surprisingly good.

> I've actually done a pretty good job learning to walk away from those conversations and just take time and watch a lot of Tamers. I mean all the pony stuff really I've done intentionally and even last Friday when stuff got to an extreme I just took a half hour in the middle of the workday to catch up on the new Tamers unofficial clip and it was, it was so refreshing and rejuvenating. It's what she used to be and it feels absolutely amazing to find that again and find something that clicks emotionally.

> I just can't live for other people like this anymore.
(reffering to sacrificing my joy for the mmission)

> I don't think I've ever felt my values so clearly before. They've really cemented this last year

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Dec/20.md

> I wish I had more time all the time to bring things to the world, and one of the reasons that I don't is because of my personal entanglements, and that sucks. It sucks a lot. I want to give time. I like giving time to my family, and I remember what it was like to only be trading and to be lonely. But even when I was in that place, it was really self-created during polyphasic because I did sincerely have family then, and it was just not helpful at all.

> My pony friends and artists were so really super nice to me with heartwarming DMs! And even some people from work reached out, which was really touching. My heart was warmed by them, and it means a ton.

> I have what I need for a real shot at my own story. That’s pretty fricking cool and exciting C:

> I do finally have mastery over all the trading aspects, onto 8 and 9 plus. It took a long time to get them, and I am happy for it.

> I feel a lot like Twilight getting her wings, and had a nice moment to recollect on such about an hour ago. Was nice to enjoy some childhood pasts and reconnect with early experiences. Damn man, I literally was back to picturing RD when with K earlier today.
(re Chives and Bur VC)

> That work of pastel equines has influenced me so deeply. It was there for me when everyone else left, and it showed me such a magical better way.

> I remember her doing that all the time back at the tail end of college, and it's nice to get back to that feeling again. She's so feminine, and I love it so, so much. I really hope things are gonna work well when I run out of money in a couple months lol.

> It can get tough with so much to accomplish, but I've found myself really effectively looking forward and just taking my time to do things, knowing that all I need to do is keep persisting and the path ahead will reveal itself.

> ...it kind of feels like K, where I finally have someone I can just be myself with and not need to continue spraying up this act of business professionalism (in the working case).

> I really appreciate how everyone I know and love gives me the leeway to be myself, with time left in solitude to explore and become my own best person.

> K was super happy to see me back, and the drive home was really nice, getting to hear about how everything went for her the last week. She had a tough time when I was gone, which I notice is a common thing for her
(after ski trip)

> Can't wait to have fun with her doing such in the immediate weekend, as we prep for her very special birthday and V-Day. Sometimes I think Corey would puke at a few things I do

> We even got to do a whole Mario Party before some more work with LEGOs and painting fun. And what an awesome salad she makes. I'm very thankful she's in my world to make it fun.

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Jan/14.md


> I've had a sort of weird feeling today that I never remember having before. Before I get into it, I was thankful for K, who was extremely cute helping me up into work this morning. She even brought me a delicious tea... So this feeling I'm having, it's a reliance on others

> that Ken Ashcorp lyric lately: A girl's worth is measured by her denier

> I've been thinking about what I'd like everything to look like once she doesn't need to work anymore.

> One key aspect is travel planning... But when it happens, I can see her going into a relatively masculine state. She gets all short and testing-ish.

> I try so hard to give people the leeway to fail, but on sizable things like a luxury hotel, it can be challenging to bite my tongue when I see very plainly that ten minutes of research would save material sums. But of course, this is the trade-off of letting others do things and make mistakes. I know I need to let them fail and learn on their own for longstanding effectiveness.

> What I should really do is chat with Corey Wayne one of these days.

> ...he sings that he "just thought it would be nice, to not have to pay the price." I know it sounds crazy because it's already been so long, but I'm coming to recognize just the huge lifetime of work that lies ahead of me to achieve these society-changing goals. It makes me think back to the easier times of simple trading even through the inefficiencies of central brokers, when everything was so much easier.
(re her AS easy)

> I find I get really hard on myself... And even though things might not always go flawlessly, I feel that I am always putting my best hoof forward to become the most exceptional person I can be.

> I think back at all those formative lessons, and I compare myself to the flawless execution I know I'm capable of. I appreciate this confidence and understanding. But now I want to just accept things for how they are and keep moving forward.

> I've helped a lot around the house lately... I also helped her with the car tires... she accepts my focus on work so far as to not focus on managing her retirement assets anymore. That was really a big drag which introduced... a lot because of how much I care about asset management, and I feel really good to be completely free of all managerial thoughts after the transition is done.

> ...felt exactly like embracing a free market for the first time in a long time

> [brony music] and some time on the swingset are the two things I've locally found to help take my mind off the deepest work.

> Lol she was like "just make your own food," which resulted in a dozen pints of Nick's at the start.
(last week so 13th-15 meeting)

> I remember I used to make desserts and casseroles galore during Uberman with all the time and caloric necessity. But I've (thankfully in a way) moved myself past that use of time, at least to the extent that it doesn't help at all to dissociate from working thoughts. The lack of a dishwasher for the last year might have a factor to do with this, but it was a developing trend even back in Atlanta.

> I've tried limiting external (non-Kayla) chats to once a day, and generally continuing to avoid public spaces. It's been working pretty well, and I haven't gone off the rails yet... family extends not to my parents or relatives because even those are sadly nonpersonal to the fullest extent of a partner I don't have to keep a story with.

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Jul/20.md


> I might not be perfect at all this relationship stuff, but I'm so thankful I have something real to base all my work on before the glow up, because after that point it's practically impossible.

> the work got so hard on some nights that I caved and popped into a trial of YouTube Music just to keep the energy flowing. While I thoroughly enjoy the time there, I'm thinking about dropping the gym membership and just using local equipment + a pair of running shoes. I just cannot for some reason get over the constant centralized music

> I think K was right about how the real world has lots of people I get to talk to
(akin to later Mom)

> Today I went through a bunch of old photos with both of us together and just started bawling.

> It was also the first time I've been to church since Italy two years ago.

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Jun/15.md


> I turned back on old photos K and I took together all these years. I was brought to tears in happiness reviewing just how much we'd done together.

> I have so much to live for now. So much on the line.

> I've been taking more and more walks around the park lately to help center myself and find peace.

> I'm very thankful for all she's put into that and cleaning up the house.
