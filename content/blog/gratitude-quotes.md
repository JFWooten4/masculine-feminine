> what's the point of having two people work when one of them is a billionaire

> That's one thing I absolutely love about K... provably not engrossed in monetary interests, as can so commonly corrupt the bonds between a man and a woman.

> That's one thing I absolutely love about K, that I know it by and large will be the only relationship I enjoy which is provably not engrossed in monetary interests, as can so commonly corrupt the bonds between a man and a woman. The lack of marriage from Musk rings true to these observations on a surface level. I just know that right now I need stability in quite a few ways, as I've enjoyed for years from her, and ideally that can continue transforming me into my most productive self at any ego-indulgent cost.

> God it was so lonely sleeping by myself. I realized that the only reason I used to get up at 4am was because I had to bend my life around the will of other people.

> She was sooooo much more feminine back then

> But now she's supporting them financially. And that's fucking unacceptable in my book. It's about as bad as me living at home with my mom.

> I always thought there'd be this big and fast glow up to skyrocket me to the 7 billion, and that's just not the case.

> if we take this slower longer view, my support system outside work becomes much more important.

> I do deserve color and perfection realized by attaining what I want most in my heart.

> I've had the fortune of examining every dark crevasse previously hidden away under a decade of masking. It's not worth living that life anymore

>  in the past I just have never really set boundaries before. I've never had to. I was sort of like a kid that just ate anything and that's exactly how it was growing up. I just ate every single piece of food available until I learned about calories in the ninth grade health class, and then you know I started caring about my health and realizing I didn't even, I mean it sounds silly, but I didn't even realize what you ate affected your body, which was the only way that I could really see my health because I was so big, and then I started, you know, I didn't eat sugar for half a year and I just focused on healthy food, a lot of spinach, a lot of meat, and it changed my life. Completely changed my life. Well now I'm sort of doing that with boundaries. I think I've probably set the first real boundary ever

> I got pretty stressed and pressured during some of the coding just because right now the coding is a little bit of a remnant of me doing a lot of things to be politically savvy and now that I've shaved away the relationship I'm also shaving those aspects away. I don't have to perform as much for the commission.

> I've been able to start talking to people again and I'm doing a very good job at it because everything is not being drained into this pit so to speak, and it feels surprisingly good.

> I've actually done a pretty good job learning to walk away from those conversations and just take time and watch a lot of Tamers. I mean all the pony stuff really I've done intentionally and even last Friday when stuff got to an extreme I just took a half hour in the middle of the workday to catch up on the new Tamers unofficial clip and it was, it was so refreshing and rejuvenating. It's what she used to be and it feels absolutely amazing to find that again and find something that clicks emotionally.

> I just can't live for other people like this anymore.
(reffering to sacrificing my joy for the mmission)

> I don't think I've ever felt my values so clearly before. They've really cemented this last year

> I wish I had more time all the time to bring things to the world, and one of the reasons that I don't is because of my personal entanglements, and that sucks. It sucks a lot. I want to give time. I like giving time to my family, and I remember what it was like to only be trading and to be lonely. But even when I was in that place, it was really self-created during polyphasic because I did sincerely have family then, and it was just not helpful at all.

> My pony friends and artists were so really super nice to me with heartwarming DMs! And even some people from work reached out, which was really touching. My heart was warmed by them, and it means a ton.

> I have what I need for a real shot at my own story. That’s pretty fricking cool and exciting C:

> I do finally have mastery over all the trading aspects, onto 8 and 9 plus. It took a long time to get them, and I am happy for it.
