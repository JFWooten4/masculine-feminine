> God it was so lonely sleeping by myself. I realized that the only reason I used to get up at 4am was because I had to bend my life around the will of other people.

> She was sooooo much more feminine back then

> But now she's supporting them financially. And that's fucking unacceptable in my book. It's about as bad as me living at home with my mom.

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2024/Oct/28.md


> what's the point of having two people work when one of them is a billionaire

> That's one thing I absolutely love about K... provably not engrossed in monetary interests, as can so commonly corrupt the bonds between a man and a woman.

> That's one thing I absolutely love about K, that I know it by and large will be the only relationship I enjoy which is provably not engrossed in monetary interests, as can so commonly corrupt the bonds between a man and a woman. The lack of marriage from Musk rings true to these observations on a surface level. I just know that right now I need stability in quite a few ways, as I've enjoyed for years from her, and ideally that can continue transforming me into my most productive self at any ego-indulgent cost.

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2024/Dec/1.md


> It can get tough with so much to accomplish, but I've found myself really effectively looking forward and just taking my time to do things, knowing that all I need to do is keep persisting and the path ahead will reveal itself.

> ...it kind of feels like K, where I finally have someone I can just be myself with and not need to continue spraying up this act of business professionalism (in the working case).

> I really appreciate how everyone I know and love gives me the leeway to be myself, with time left in solitude to explore and become my own best person.

> K was super happy to see me back, and the drive home was really nice, getting to hear about how everything went for her the last week. She had a tough time when I was gone, which I notice is a common thing for her
(after ski trip)

> Can't wait to have fun with her doing such in the immediate weekend, as we prep for her very special birthday and V-Day. Sometimes I think Corey would puke at a few things I do

> We even got to do a whole Mario Party before some more work with LEGOs and painting fun. And what an awesome salad she makes. I'm very thankful she's in my world to make it fun.

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Jan/14.md


> I've had a sort of weird feeling today that I never remember having before. Before I get into it, I was thankful for K, who was extremely cute helping me up into work this morning. She even brought me a delicious tea... So this feeling I'm having, it's a reliance on others

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Jan/15.md


> that Ken Ashcorp lyric lately: A girl's worth is measured by her denier

> I've been thinking about what I'd like everything to look like once she doesn't need to work anymore.

> One key aspect is travel planning... But when it happens, I can see her going into a relatively masculine state. She gets all short and testing-ish.

> I try so hard to give people the leeway to fail, but on sizable things like a luxury hotel, it can be challenging to bite my tongue when I see very plainly that ten minutes of research would save material sums. But of course, this is the trade-off of letting others do things and make mistakes. I know I need to let them fail and learn on their own for longstanding effectiveness.

> What I should really do is chat with Corey Wayne one of these days.

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Jan/23.md


> I feel a lot like Twilight getting her wings, and had a nice moment to recollect on such about an hour ago. Was nice to enjoy some childhood pasts and reconnect with early experiences. Damn man, I literally was back to picturing RD when with K earlier today.
(re Chives and Bur VC)

> That work of pastel equines has influenced me so deeply. It was there for me when everyone else left, and it showed me such a magical better way.

> I remember her doing that all the time back at the tail end of college, and it's nice to get back to that feeling again. She's so feminine, and I love it so, so much. I really hope things are gonna work well when I run out of money in a couple months lol.
(re interruptive sex)

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Feb/18.md


> I'm done trying to keep satisfying my parents and give into easy fun activities just because they'd otherwise be expensive to do independently. And I fucking mean that for these damn credit-card and bank offers too

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Mar/22.md


> it's been reasonably documented in here that I've sometimes wondered about different paths, fearing a miss of the paths so tempting. I'm glad to say that's all behind me, and I find myself fully committed to the course now. There's nothing else but the path I've chosen, and I'm never looking back.

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Mar/28.md


> Today I took another look at K's picture book... That scrapbook always makes me cry, and I love her so much. Particularly love this incredible thing she made all those years back. I can't believe we met under such inspired circumstances as the sneeze happened.

> I can't wait to marry her.

> I truly feel like those kids out there, playing around and doing everything I love each day.

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/May/27.md


> She just made me a pasta with seasonings and an egg that was to die for@! I feel complete in every sense of the word on the inside. I'm so thankful for this massive fulfillment and loving community constantly supporting us in an endeavor to my goal objective.

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Jun/2.md


> Lol I haven't slept hahahaha Man I'm tired. Lol we have to get on the flight in like an hour brughhsgghs.
(no Response items)

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Jun/5.md AM


> I think K was right about how the real world has lots of people I get to talk to
(akin to later Mom)

> Today I went through a bunch of old photos with both of us together and just started bawling.

> It was also the first time I've been to church since Italy two years ago.

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Jun/15.md


> I turned back on old photos K and I took together all these years. I was brought to tears in happiness reviewing just how much we'd done together.

> I have so much to live for now. So much on the line.

> I've been taking more and more walks around the park lately to help center myself and find peace.

> I'm very thankful for all she's put into that and cleaning up the house.

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Jun/17.md
(day ofter Response 3, day of 4)


> ...he sings that he "just thought it would be nice, to not have to pay the price." I know it sounds crazy because it's already been so long, but I'm coming to recognize just the huge lifetime of work that lies ahead of me to achieve these society-changing goals. It makes me think back to the easier times of simple trading even through the inefficiencies of central brokers, when everything was so much easier.
(re her AS easy)

> I find I get really hard on myself... And even though things might not always go flawlessly, I feel that I am always putting my best hoof forward to become the most exceptional person I can be.

> I think back at all those formative lessons, and I compare myself to the flawless execution I know I'm capable of. I appreciate this confidence and understanding. But now I want to just accept things for how they are and keep moving forward.

> I've helped a lot around the house lately... I also helped her with the car tires... she accepts my focus on work so far as to not focus on managing her retirement assets anymore. That was really a big drag which introduced... a lot because of how much I care about asset management, and I feel really good to be completely free of all managerial thoughts after the transition is done.

> ...felt exactly like embracing a free market for the first time in a long time

> [brony music] and some time on the swingset are the two things I've locally found to help take my mind off the deepest work.

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Jul/17.md


> Lol she was like "just make your own food," which resulted in a dozen pints of Nick's at the start.
(last week so 13th-15 meeting)

> I remember I used to make desserts and casseroles galore during Uberman with all the time and caloric necessity. But I've (thankfully in a way) moved myself past that use of time, at least to the extent that it doesn't help at all to dissociate from working thoughts. The lack of a dishwasher for the last year might have a factor to do with this, but it was a developing trend even back in Atlanta.

> I've tried limiting external (non-Kayla) chats to once a day, and generally continuing to avoid public spaces. It's been working pretty well, and I haven't gone off the rails yet... family extends not to my parents or relatives because even those are sadly nonpersonal to the fullest extent of a partner I don't have to keep a story with.

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Jul/20.md


> I might not be perfect at all this relationship stuff, but I'm so thankful I have something real to base all my work on before the glow up, because after that point it's practically impossible.

> the work got so hard on some nights that I caved and popped into a trial of YouTube Music just to keep the energy flowing. While I thoroughly enjoy the time there, I'm thinking about dropping the gym membership and just using local equipment + a pair of running shoes. I just cannot for some reason get over the constant centralized music

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Jul/27.md


> I'm having a really tough time... I just wish I had somebody in my life who actually understood this side of me.
(re pone pronouns)

> it literally feels exactly like Apple Bottom/Split

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Jul/30.md


> I feel quite clouded when I can't express this side of me.

> happily together

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Aug/5.md


You can see things start to get pretty bad around JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Aug/8.md


> And that's what I've been wrestling with lately as I face the commitment to marriage. It's something I had to contend with years strong and past with choosing Stellar as the sole chain to implement TAD3. And I always had it present with the administrative SEC relationship.

> I think I'm coming to terms with things. And I'm ready to let go of fear and give it a shot. I just don't see a single other path forward.

> There's a special and direct feeling I get when doing the real intense work. It's a fragile state that takes a lot, and it's just so much harder to get there or maintain it when placed under external constraints... I know I've given up a lot in personal gain terms. And I can accept... this void of food, friends, or fun.

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Sep/3.md


> I appreciate that I can step back and see the socializing as something that really unfortunately does not fuel me. It came only from my own overexertion. And I see that I need to disconnect from this excess stimulation to stay the course.

> I guess also thanks to Tamers for dropping something so different today. In the watch party I really saw through my own eyes just how nonadditive this has been in my life. I am glad for the fun and games I got to enjoy, especially alongside family, but I understand it's just depriving my crucial reserves for fruitless personal hedonics ✌🏼

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Sep/4.md
(YO is this denial??)


> I wish I had the free-caringness to get nice funs like that on an impulse.
(re her getting toy)

> there's a lot of sensory stimulation like driving and talking or music at the Outback she finally got to take me to.

> Well here I am, everything right and myself as Mr. Right. It doesn't really feel all that high up like framing out to be.

> It's time to ease away from that attention drain anyway to focus on the mission. I know it's not as sexy, but I am able and damn willing to pursue it in this condition. To change course now would needlessly delay it all
(re contemplating the relationship)

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Sep/6.md


> there's just nothing I'm going to be able to change at this point life-wise

> I have got who I am down pat.

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Sep/11.md


> I want to renounce politicking in all its forms and get down to business.

> I’m coming to terms with the permanence of her temporary existence as an interim placeholder.
(coming to terms with the fact that she’s in your life for now, filling a space or role, but not meant to be permanent)

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Sep/22.md


> It was a big, huge, massive (pick one lol) day for work, but it came with equivalent personal costs. It's been like this for some time

> I know I can make things anew because I deserve happiness.

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Sep/26.md


> I am thinking I have the strength now in her cooking to go full off sugar even if nothing changes with sponsors. That's an exciting feeling for me because it gives me back permission to work at my pace. It was a crazy intense year that taught me the meaning of burnout.

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Oct/2.md


> I am happy things are so vibrant, but I'm questioning whether this living situation can accommodate the immense amount of work I need to complete. I thought my foundation was solid bedrock, but now I'm realizing it could be the same mud everyone else uses. I just want something closer to the market.

> I love the market so much. I don't understand how I lost it, but I respect my choices to favor integrity over xxxxx (idk, what do you call it: adrenaline, joy, happiness?). There's something to investing that's just so amazing, and I wish I had someone who could share that feeling with me.

> It's been so much progress lately in oral conversation that I can't close my eyes or turn off my brain. I even cancelled my gym membership some weeks back to take out ancillary noisiness and focus on absorbing the sentiment growth all around. I want to give my complete and total ability to the cause once we are funded, because I care about asset management more than anything in the world and will show everyone just how amazing I can be with a portfolio made of friendship.

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Oct/16.md


> I was so ingrained in pointing out the flaws within the CCP structure that I forgot who I am and what I care about.

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Oct/21.md


> Lately discussion of politics has been a real bore on me. It's just gotten less and less fun to censor myself out of respect for a dilapidated status quo. Even though the power is completely lopsided, my friends are supporting me to speak the truth and be myself.

> I want to hold the line

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Oct/23.md


> I can't shake the feeling of needing to be alone.

> I keep making friends with trans girls, and I just want to say like lol so much fkn easier than real women. Like I just appreciate the upfrontness that doesn't leave me filtering every waking word through a bureaucratic process.

> I miss that feeling of what happiness was like, and I hope I can find it soon. I've been recharging my batteries on X feeds full of ponies, which has been awesome and even led to some new friends.

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Nov/3.md


> I know love is important

> I want to find it again someday

> I know that I love her but I just can't stand in this environment anymore

> like how it was way back then with my Mom

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Nov/5.md


> It feels like a balancing act between my body's energy sources. And I need someone who will help replenish the supply no matter what.

> I needed to change the relationship to get into the right place for completion. How can I write about free markets when my own living situation traps me in conformity?... my environment was not conducive to my necessary expression.

> I feel like an eagle flying through the sky rather than a person soaring in the confines of a metal tube. It's an incredible fleeting feeling. And I know what I must do to get more of it.

> My energy has been changing and Kayla picks it up really well because we are very synchronized. I'm going to miss her and I hope she finds what she's looking for in life.

> certain mental roadblocks slowed down my ability to timely respond to material online communications. I believe this stems from the additional mental load I've taken on preprocessing narratives with Kayla. Her responses to unsavvy wording instilled a necessity for flawlessness which is a bar too high for immediate friends

(3 days after decidng to leave & day of partner post)


> I want to become a whole person

> I appreciate that I get to go as fast as I can

> I am thankful for my extended family and even not-in-laws for having fun together in moments away. I really liked the forced time away.

> It’s been so many years of trying to perform for everyone else, and I can’t express just how amazing it felt to finally do things for myself for a change. This weekend of pone was literally unbelievable and life-changing. I have not felt myself in about eight years up until this convention.

> I met this girl and we started chatting on Discord until things escalated to ERP

> I just started dancing with random girls! Omg it was like so fun—hahaha I’ve never felt so free before! We’d just do some back and forth during random songs and then move around to other mares.

> It’s been a while since I had people look at me like that, and even intentionally getting physical with me

> it was fkn unbelievable how good it felt after that dance to completely freak out to this insane music which lately has felt so deeply bound to my soul’s desires. I literally felt like a different person on the moon by the end of that set, it was so fkn cool.

> this was sincerely the piece I’d been ignoring and missing all these years

> I just got to unshamely and greedily be myself for the first time.

> I appreciate that I am given independence and not recognized by anyone here... I’ve had this thing for a very long time where I concern over that Russian plant thing where they have a really hot woman target a successful guy... I thought just having Kayla with an affirmed strong base would be the answer to that, but it was an exceptionally centralized viewpoint.

> I’ve particularly enjoyed dancing with my eyes closed, it feels connected to my subconscious and just lets me think without acknowledging anyone passively. Again with the ignoring cameras and just being unfiltered... I just want to express my own feelings in motion.

> The fren in the news shared sticker that reads “on top of the world” with care package and Apple Bottom, and that’s really how things felt as they finally died down in the end.

> I have to also thank the intensity of the DEX documentation work, because without that—none of this would’ve happened. The SEC review primed the pump and got me to the breaking point, but it was the necessity of completing the DEX docs which pushed me over the edge. Once I realized that I couldn’t do what I needed to do (to get to my goals) with that surrounding, I was able to make the tough call with the most amount of clarity one has in something like this.

> I met her 19-yo daughter Sara who idk like yeah she was hot whoopie. My type? Lol not really. No clues about the fandom or even esports, which was like damn. The world and even primal parts of me expect myself to rocket towards that, but like I just feel absolutely nothing and couldn’t care less... (i) feels a little exploitive to bring someone like that into bed? (ii) not intellectually stimulating to continue requesting information and (iii) unprogressive towards my objectives to engage in such short-term behaviours.

> I want to build something real and, while I’m happy to entertain limited family requests, I need my own space and relationships to do so well.

> I can’t go back. I can never go back.
(re rules of centralized asset management)

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Nov/29.md


> finally feel like I'm on the other side

> I have found my heart and soul again

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Dec/3.md


> I always thought there'd be this big and fast glow up to skyrocket me to the 7 billion, and that's just not the case.

> if we take this slower longer view, my support system outside work becomes much more important.

> I do deserve color and perfection realized by attaining what I want most in my heart.
(she was great but...)

> I've had the fortune of examining every dark crevasse previously hidden away under a decade of masking. It's not worth living that life anymore

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Dec/5.md


>  in the past I just have never really set boundaries before. I've never had to. I was sort of like a kid that just ate anything and that's exactly how it was growing up. I just ate every single piece of food available until I learned about calories in the ninth grade health class, and then you know I started caring about my health and realizing I didn't even, I mean it sounds silly, but I didn't even realize what you ate affected your body, which was the only way that I could really see my health because I was so big, and then I started, you know, I didn't eat sugar for half a year and I just focused on healthy food, a lot of spinach, a lot of meat, and it changed my life. Completely changed my life. Well now I'm sort of doing that with boundaries. I think I've probably set the first real boundary ever

> I got pretty stressed and pressured during some of the coding just because right now the coding is a little bit of a remnant of me doing a lot of things to be politically savvy and now that I've shaved away the relationship I'm also shaving those aspects away. I don't have to perform as much for the commission.

> I've been able to start talking to people again and I'm doing a very good job at it because everything is not being drained into this pit so to speak, and it feels surprisingly good.

> I've actually done a pretty good job learning to walk away from those conversations and just take time and watch a lot of Tamers. I mean all the pony stuff really I've done intentionally and even last Friday when stuff got to an extreme I just took a half hour in the middle of the workday to catch up on the new Tamers unofficial clip and it was, it was so refreshing and rejuvenating. It's what she used to be and it feels absolutely amazing to find that again and find something that clicks emotionally.

> I just can't live for other people like this anymore.
(reffering to sacrificing my joy for the mmission)

> I don't think I've ever felt my values so clearly before. They've really cemented this last year

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Dec/20.md


> I wish I had more time all the time to bring things to the world, and one of the reasons that I don't is because of my personal entanglements, and that sucks. It sucks a lot. I want to give time. I like giving time to my family, and I remember what it was like to only be trading and to be lonely. But even when I was in that place, it was really self-created during polyphasic because I did sincerely have family then, and it was just not helpful at all.
(re dad lunch)

- JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/2025/Dec/21.md


> My pony friends and artists were so really super nice to me with heartwarming DMs! And even some people from work reached out, which was really touching. My heart was warmed by them, and it means a ton.

> I have what I need for a real shot at my own story. That’s pretty fricking cool and exciting C:

> I do finally have mastery over all the trading aspects, onto 8 and 9 plus. It took a long time to get them, and I am happy for it.
