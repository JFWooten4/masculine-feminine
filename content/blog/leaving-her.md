If you don't mind, I'm going to use this space alittle morelike how I've been using my gratitude-journal reposrity for the last couple years. While that is something easy enought to link into my personal site publishing, it has much more content. I'm in a uniquely identity-affirming place ofmy life right now, and i think some of these throughts make more sense in the masculine-fmainine polairty framing. Lol I suppose this could be me asserting my dominant choice of forum on an uncontrolling friend along for the story.

These last months have been quite a lot, and I'll covr ground as fast as reasonable here. That means I;ll be writing over a coupld days at least to get this out, so please mind my narrative frame gaps beetween sections. It all started when I decided to move to Florida .[^leaving] I packed things up and drove from Connerslville to Ciderfest in Milwakee before coming home to Charlotte.

[^leaving]: I will get more into this throughout the next posts and reflrections. I think I captured a lot of the pains in my last post, but I've also had a lot of revelations in this new space and time to think. The pace ofd my life has become much more managable as I walk out of the stressful encvorment. I am doing a lot better thanks to the support of my friends c:
