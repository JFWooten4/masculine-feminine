If you don't mind, I'm going to use this space alittle morelike how I've been using my gratitude-journal reposrity for the last couple years. While that is something easy enought to link into my personal site publishing, it has much more content.[^public] I'm in a uniquely identity-affirming place ofmy life right now, and i think some of these throughts make more sense in the masculine-fmainine polairty framing. Lol I suppose this could be me asserting my dominant choice of forum on an uncontrolling friend along for the story.

These last months have been quite a lot, and I'll covr ground as fast as reasonable here. That means I;ll be writing over a coupld days at least to get this out, so please mind my narrative frame gaps beetween sections. It all started when I decided to move to Florida .[^leaving] I packed things up and drove from Connerslville to Ciderfest in Milwakee before coming home to Charlotte.

[^leaving]: I will get more into this throughout the next posts and reflrections. I think I captured a lot of the pains in my last post, but I've also had a lot of revelations in this new space and time to think. The pace ofd my life has become much more managable as I walk out of the stressful encvorment. I am doing a lot better thanks to the support of my friends c:

[^public]: Relevant to this ispoint is that this writing has a static site deployment URL, which I'veshared with clse friends like artists fom last post and Kayla, who responded quite affectionately to what I've written after reading it all. I remmeber thinking of this as ap rivate palce, and it defienately affects my abiltiy to process and move forward quickly since I have ot now consider broader viewpoints and signlling iplicaions. I emrember makign the change in my jurnal to public and experiencign the same senstaion, a feeliong which I think helps force me to think things through more full y at the cost fo less emotinla rawness.[^privates] This is a new territory for me because all I've done for so long is excuciatingly document my professional work, which I intend to continue by not  deleting blogs or privately drafting confidential posts.

[^privates]: When I started the blog, I thought I'd have a list of all the cons I went to with their own reflecting posts plus a black book of mares over the years. In the former case, I've found such a ttmeendous overwhel m of sensational emotions which were quite formative but not neccesarily prodctivoe reflective items . It dosnt; really help anyone, including myslef, to lament on all the spectaucular panels and crazy finu times we all had in this space, in my case becasue I already have those amazing memories upstairs. And as for the public list of anonymoized noncomitted relationshjips (or at least polar times), I've also realized in exploring my deepest joys throughout the fandom these last months that there are some things you just remeber as a part of you which don;t need to be shouted out to the world in docs.
