THe first post was pretty muh flawless, and that's efinately the dynamic I'm goin for here. Bt it was so much effort hat I really though t abut abandoing this whole project .  I have ery specific needs i nmy life that I've learned over years of trial and effrororr.

The msotformative time in my life was when  dsicovered marekts. They showed me a kind of freedom I couldn't imagine in my pre-teens. I wasn't shut out because of my age, and I could channel everythign through text chat (or voice-only, at worst) in a way that just let me be another eer participant on the same playing field as everyone else.

Tha was so special to me, becuase I grew p in a very centralized and hierarchal household. My Dad made a million dollars in 2008, working at one of the bailed-out bandks. To say thigns were n a tight liock is an undertatmenet, and it was evident in the strinctness within my parents' relationship. They only made it a couple more years after that, divorcing around the time that I discorered the TF2 hat bazaar.s [^1]

[^1]: They're both excpetional people who I appreicate so much. They bviosily love me immensely, and I ealyappreciate their emotional support.  I connet deeply wiht hte relationship Flalwless has wto Trwi and Twixie, and I love how they're friends (or more) that she can turn to in had times.

##

Te more I dsiover about the fandom, the more I woner about my current situation living with Kayla. I see these incredible love stories that look like pure beautry on the publi outside. I honestly didn't even know that was possible.
Kayla's wanted t oget married as far back as I can remember, and honestlyl it makes me sick just thinkign about that. Things changed a lot when she started working fulltime. She lost the energ to ep at us.[^1]

[^1]: There are a lot of nuances here, and she's an amazing partner. I hink I started asking more of her earlier this year when work intensified. As stress followed, she took on more of the cooking around the house  hwich i just dont' want to write about rn

I use to et this wam feelign around her; even got hard at sight on her arrival to date nights. But that was a long time ago, and I'm trying to pick up the pieces to see what's left here to salvage. I plan to get some professional help loally.

### speerateion

In thinign abotu whether I needed this creative relaionship space, I reviewed how I could work through these feeligns myself. I am dealing quite intimately with who I will become, and there isn't a on of teching I plan to do . Ive been down that path before, and it's just not the best use of m time, especially in something like realtionships.

I thout mayb it was too cuh to entrally track all the experiences I had here. That I could work through thins on my own. And , to an extend, that's still wh I'm doing.[^1]

[^1]: For instnac,e I hvne't pupopualted the communty discord ink in the last post. Tere's stil n way for you to contact me. And I've eprecated my old assoiated Dsicord user accoutn.


### shift

But I want to drop all that for now. The hing I've been most peeved about lately is that my relationshhip seems to detract directly from my working efforts. The harder I go in my days, the worse shit I get from her at night. That could be the determining straw, but again I will take some time ot think about itmore.

I usd to lke that attribute about her. It was a litmus test of how centralized I was becoming. Anyime I put too much in or becausem an unnecesasyr chopoint or fulcrum, I couldn emain e her reacion to see where I went wrong.

But I'm approaching the end of my introdcutory period owith the FOundation. An honeslty that was what I needed most of this trainign for, especially now that I have the COmmmission on my side. I hve to devide if I wat to spend the rest of my life tipting in beurocraciesrather than shooting into the heart of portenial
I think I''ll understand a lt more after I erge in 723. Things are lookign really good on the Comunity Fund side. I'll wait for the chickens to hatch before counting in a mre comprehensive review.

## Work
Anyway, I just ahd to write a post today beuase it wa a huge politcking week. I chieed what I'd been wokring on for thee weeks at hte behest of a communtiy intrducion. [^1]

[^1]: THe introduction was through a mention in a siginficant X thread. I spent days typing out the reply, which was my last post under premium over the normal 240 character limit. I don't plan to renew premium becuase fuck your entralied soial media ;)

### resp

At first, the rsponse served as an inspiation for the ommunity show tat wek. t was really fun shooting aorund with Truth, and I'm so excited to have them in the ocmmuntiy.

i'm going to try avoiding the cloe friends in posts like these, because that's not really what I'm tryin to get at with the whole relationship politcking. This is another thing that's riven me away from Kayla.

I found all these amazing lcose work friends who accept me for who I am in ever regaurd. And I tried to do the same for Kayla. But I was lawyas filtering with teh Aspergers masking.

Ealier this year when I stopped masking, thigns really deteriorated. It's become clear that my most raw form could be too much for her. I'm still living with that ti o see how she reats as I continue my examination.


### cont'd

I was closing iout the working items in my agenda like nromal when I reched out to the relevant introducotry point. We have interacted a few times over hte years, and I respect their technical copetance. But they aren't super close, and I actualyl just cajoled them into joining the Discoord actually.

This is closer to the kind of perosn who I need to apply my skills to at the start, making a good impression. But once I realized their anayticall ness, I knew we were both on the same page. This also came from epxlct statements agreeing on the problem s with tZERO.

That's why I losed things out with a brief message letting them know how I was wlakign away. I put a lot of wokr into hte rpely, bu I know it oul'v been better. I was sick after the third day of trying to get it perfet, andso I just got fed up and sent it out.

Broadly, i am at the limit of my politcking efforts. I do plan to drop all acts in the coming future, and I think I'm startinghta mycoiming out with a brony profile picture. I hoenslty just on't care anymore, adn I have a big anough moat at work that I can fkn doinit.


### rep

But just as I was about to wlak away from the Wall St assholes, [^1]

[^1]: I am trying to cal m my languageodwn around here. I want to bew  al eittle more peaeful on thne daily, which menas isolating and minimizing yeeligns for the middlemen of past. Anger is just oo distracting


(contiuing sentnece) -- which I think iwll jsut make my lifea hwole lot easier. After i laid out how veryhting out collapse to the regualtors, I sort of sotpped feeling the ened to conitue down that avenue. Fuck em, ya know.

## The Desire for Power

Impefet as it as, Mark was awesome enough to reply to my comment with an excpetional leading question. When i shot back a dead-on answer, we finally goa direct meeting reuest from the CEO alan . No matter what happens next, I win.

I can craft this narrative of public infomation . It's important in my mind to alwyas take this autious approach ith adveraries, who I've foudn often stop ay nothing includin future alterations to public information.[^1]

[^1]: For intnace, Reutorers just censored tow years of GME articles. They mateirally amended languaged related to SEC review. Take a wild guess at who prompted this change boys.

### update

However, upon cheking my own source for this claim, I realized that we atually hoit a straight0shot home run with this. It seems they replied within a couple hours of my request for a meetingopublickly affirming a spekaign appreance. This is literalyl a first-of-oits-kind discussion at this cslare critizing a _very_ important topic in my industry. I have five days to prepare for what will be my introduction to the Executive branch by means of Patrick Bryne. Honeslty cannto overstate how important this is. 

I'll spend the remainder of this post descibing the mens I used to achive this resutl.

### inentional helpenssness

I had a relatively intimidating `pilot` profile pucture on X at the start of this enagnement, where I was in the cockput of an old bomber. I changed this to a naive headshot takedn form when I was in high school. This paints me as a much younger, but still suit-and-stie, professional in a clambing blue light.

COlros matter a lot, and they are well esteblushed mby commnrical braidnign experts. I tend around black, blue, purpole, and sometimes white.

The black is for my day-to-day, ebcuase it keeps the stress of my eyes starting at screens endlessly. But it alos protects my daly life. Balck is the safest color, and it avoids undue attention. 

For soemone like me that wants a low prfile to avoid human interaction balck helps with that. It's a simple olro to style around beause you chose to have no creative output. For isntnace, it's the pupils alone in my OC, an indeed it is in mymind the antithesis of reativity. For when I need pure reliable stability, I turn to black.

Blue is peaceful. Used to calm enemies or calm mysle.f Nd it's by far the most trustful color I can approach t public woiht.

I used it a lot more when I was younger, teaching and introduing myself to the worl. It's always what I planned to wear to tstimony, and I keep it in myind in daily objects I nedto trust. It colors my phone case, water bottles, and refill jugs while matchign the olor or water and life.

These last months, I've also om to itnerpet blue as   color of childhood youthfullnes. As a boy, it was the major color known to the world through sonic the hedhog. I see it more in my older , younger self and the childhood sentients I cary in blue tint.

White is just for when things need to be clean for beurocratic reivew. It's horrible on the eyes and increibly easy to dirty. but when you need something that looks perfect for a one-off centrlaized review, white will serve you well.

Puple is where things get really interesting. My personal branding code is `#AC51FF`. I love it so so much, ebcause purple repesensts innovation and creating hcange.

It is by all means the color of revolution. The capture of passion. The mix of heart and pure ecxtacy as you approach  singularity.

Most of my creative drafting amerialy locally use a purple hue to keep me thikign for the future. I used to have my whole keyboard purple jsut to promote this concept, before changing the ctuatation poitns to a faster typing method alongside a rainbow-dash colored theme. [^1]

[^1]: Love hte indiviual kaey RGB addressability of th hunstman, even if their windows sotware sucks, Or maybe it's the OS that's tha problem. Gah I loe th keyboard but hae the softwre lol!

Hah I used to tell Kayla lal baout how i wnt her o go blone, an he ooked bsilutely stunning whn she did. Gold is defiantely alnoher color or the accent signanlling the best. That is until I bust in mwith mypalladium.

It's a hufe I use sparingly, but I try to avoid the hubris of being he ost important person in the room. I do a whole lot better lurkign around in the corners until I have a uniqu opporuntiy to achieve my bjectives.

### 

So, I did a few thins to make sure an indiial read o my profile would calm own any managmeent rewivew. Th  While I must diclaim that I don;t knwo exaclty how much of a diffrene all this made, I think it mattered a lot. Thats the thinkg with poltikcing: its' like trading with none of the intermitten PNL.

Wen you buy a stock, you can track how it goes up and down, seeing in real-time how good your decision s were. Should I have wited a little bit longer? Tried a heavierwe ighteign? etc

With politcis and people, you basically have to shoot your shot and wait for a reposnes. I learned this in the beorcracies , where any additioanl context submitted after a grant proposal would weaken my position by making me ook needy. I speciifally remarekd emotional sentiments abotu Wall Street in a gut reply to publi media during a review process, whick ended up costing m $9,000 earlier this year.

The core of it is that you need to wait to let things settle. This is all a game of whits and confidence, and facts grow in conviction over time. Liek with the SCF politcks around introducing the first Rounde of the POublic Goods Award.

Here, I spent hours contructing a few sentences backed by rcticably eyears of primary research efforts. Nobody really said anything to repsond to my poss becuase people will not interrupt or immeisaly react to prescient revelations. hey need time to proess what took you ges to formulate.

Despite needing over a month to materue, I diligents ly followed the oscial signals to cease talking about my points, which had been entered into the time record. I use time a lot in my work. I  find that backlinks to when you introduce a point even just a few weeks ago (although a year+ is ideal) ive you 1000% more credbaility tha n jsut saying something equivalent on the spot. Peopel seem arbitrarily amazed that you can think of something beforehand, document it, and then bring it up in later chats. 

Not to mention, it gives you the opportuntiy to get tohters binding down your prior documented work, which prettymuch investiabtly brings them o your sie if you docuemtn thigns well enoght. I na way, yopu force them to ask if they agree with all the things youve said in the pas,t or at least the eoffrt and rigor you;ve pout in to develop it. If they appreciate that, then it now becomes not only saying no yto your current request but (in their mind) declining the authirty of all your past work hic hthey've just divoescered.

This is why I don't like in-person or phone-call first impressions.  THey odn't giving e me the ootllset of submitting substantnive introductory amterils. I do a whiole lot better not needing to exlain myself over and over again beauyse others start with a reasonable reputation.

### repeption

I learned this over hte years selling my book and ducational courses., It was just never enjoyable to repeat my "origina sorty" of dorpping out of high school to trade stocks full time. I always embellisghed it with tons of emotions and hoods,  refining it based on nonverbal feedback. ANd mand that just exhausted hte fuck out of me and I ahted it. 

### posts

Asidef from the pofile pic change , I  updatd my banner and straegically made precent posts na replies. THe basnner is such an obvous and easy first step of efetivep olitkcing on a socila playform like X. It is the biggest and first thing people see when visiting the progile, ebcuase they already clicked on your image.

When I say see, I mean the visuals, not the textual substance. Poeple are subpprisingly lazy and I don't think they gie as much weight to the wirtten items on a first run-through. THat's where the benner shines as a giant image shown at the very top of the screen, wehre theyee naturall leans


Yo uould try to make it some phoot with text htat syas something, but I think that's wasting this poopporuntiy to embed an emotional message. 

WSo it set it as this cute blue uwu drawing of Dash. It's just so perfect for the message I'm trying to convey. Someone with wonderbolt-level speed hidingbehind a mast k of voluntary deprecation.

Using yourself as a decieivningly unbale form works really well. Lsat year, during the heat of AMM drama, I extracted a confessio nfrom highlevel communtiy memebrs that AUA was centralized by naively (to them) asking my oppotnnet's argumetns of decentralization in question form. I literally took their rediculous claims, asked them like i was a tootal n00b idiot, and watched my deepest rivals make my entire argumetn for me.

It was beurtical, and thats what i love abotu lilkitics. When you get these trads right, they are just as magical as a 10X call. Albeit htey kae a lot longer to show up in you bank acount.
### postst

THis was during my transition to the brony fandom, which I will admit was probably influeced by this event. During the SEC reive wperiod, I have aserioues of commits nad PRs epxlitliy dmaning this strategy or hte sake of looking foressionally acceptable. For isntnace, I set my pfp to Flawless and chad Soarin (gay) on X and GithUB during the review, which I knw would be the polaces staff visitned while while eplring my osurce links.

I learned to consider surrounding sources when I was applying for bank accounts to access fiat trasnfers. The Syndicate had it' old `.io` site where I could change things super quick and track a little more about visitors' actions. The paprooach mirors the BTCS CEO story about how they used tracking they built to see how 90% of their website trafic ame from the SEC, watching exactly which pages they examined for securities copliance.

I found that hoilarious, and for clarity I do not do or [pa to do that. But like, it 's totally true. You have to get own to the level of IP tracing to or other gimmiky hacks to treally track political progress.

I don't think it's workth goin that far. It's a slipperly slope from there down to Snowden-levle constant suevaliance. At htat point, it's a full-tiem job which requires authority and leads to dicttorship totalitaltinaism.

I could jsutorf that with twenty pages. It's jsut not fucking worht it. It's like furnning an invesmtent commitee surrounded by huge beurocracies.

Wil lyou get better results? Yes, prbably maybe. But it's not worth the ost on human prouctivity and prospecrtiy that you leeach away from society.

N oamtter the inspiration, I ecided to jsut be myslf, and I started reposting pony images (again , images lead to easier and faster first impressions)] and rpelying to image content, in acsae they looked at hte reply tab. People get most of their first impressions within 5 seconds of a real conversastion. I think the same aplieds online, where you are steablied above the fold.


The fold is a digital marketing terms which jsut means what you cna see when you first load a page. On mobile, this is a much smaller amount of space that makes the job a little easier, asumign you know how to ismplyigfy your semessage well. IN nthis cas,e it would be the headshot, banner, and pinned post.

I made sure to poin an only brony content  Ihad , epxlaining a headhot I used for my pfp during the Review period.  I was foruntae to have that, because i think a more recent pin wouldve prmpted further investigation into my anti-Wall Street post history.

Fuck, I even posted an anti-Goldman Scachs meme like a few days ago, which should haveb een an AOBVIOUS turn off for this CEO guy . I didn't think we'd get it when I sent ti out. But it's clear from his reactions (at least to me) that he never even checked back on my prfile updates when accepting hte meeting beause my intro was so trong.

Anwya, the Fold on desktop, which I rpesume preofessional like him use, if as few posts. I made the retweets or posts with pbrony content spaced alogn a few days so that it didn't look like i was rushign to fill up my timeline with
