THe first post was pretty muh flawless, and that's efinately the dynamic I'm goin for here. Bt it was so much effort hat I really though t abut abandoing this whole project .  I have ery specific needs i nmy life that I've learned over years of trial and effrororr.

The msotformative time in my life was when  dsicovered marekts. They showed me a kind of freedom I couldn't imagine in my pre-teens. I wasn't shut out because of my age, and I could channel everythign through text chat (or voice-only, at worst) in a way that just let me be another eer participant on the same playing field as everyone else.

Tha was so special to me, becuase I grew p in a very centralized and hierarchal household. My Dad made a million dollars in 2008, working at one of the bailed-out bandks. To say thigns were n a tight liock is an undertatmenet, and it was evident in the strinctness within my parents' relationship. They only made it a couple more years after that, divorcing around the time that I discorered the TF2 hat bazaar.s [^1]

[^1]: They're both excpetional people who I appreicate so much. They bviosily love me immensely, and I ealyappreciate their emotional support.  I connet deeply wiht hte relationship Flalwless has wto Trwi and Twixie, and I love how they're friends (or more) that she can turn to in had times.

Te more I dsiover about the fandom, the more I woner about my current situation living with Kayla. I see these incredible love stories that look like pure beautry on the publi outside. I honestly didn't even know that was possible.
Kayla's wanted t oget married as far back as I can remember, and honestlyl it makes me sick just thinkign about that. Things changed a lot when she started working fulltime. She lost the energ to ep at us.[^1]

[^1]: There are a lot of nuances here, and she's an amazing partner. I hink I started asking more of her earlier this year when work intensified. As stress followed, she took on more of the cooking around the house  hwich i just dont' want to write about rn

I use to et this wam feelign around her; even got hard at sight on her arrival to date nights. But that was a long time ago, and I'm trying to pick up the pieces to see what's left here to salvage. I plan to get some professional help loally.

### speerateion

In thinign abotu whether I needed this creative relaionship space, I reviewed how I could work through these feeligns myself. I am dealing quite intimately with who I will become, and there isn't a on of teching I plan to do . Ive been down that path before, and it's just not the best use of m time, especially in something like realtionships.

I thout mayb it was too cuh to entrally track all the experiences I had here. That I could work through thins on my own. And , to an extend, that's still wh I'm doing.[^1]

[^1]: For instnac,e I hvne't pupopualted the communty discord ink in the last post. Tere's stil n way for you to contact me. And I've eprecated my old assoiated Dsicord user accoutn.
