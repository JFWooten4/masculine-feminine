The first post was pretty much flawless, and that's definitely the dynamic I'm going for here. But it was so much effort that I really thought about abandoning this whole project. I have very specific needs in my life that I've learned over years of trial and error.

The most formative time in my life was when I discovered markets. They showed me a kind of freedom I couldn't imagine in my pre-teens. I wasn't shut out because of my age, and I could channel everything through text chat (or voice-only, at worst) in a way that just let me be another peer participant on the same playing field as everyone else.

That was so special to me, because I grew up in a very centralized and hierarchical household. My dad made a million dollars in 2008, working at one of the bailed-out banks. To say things were on a tight lock is an understatement, and it was evident in the strictness within my parents' relationship. They only made it a couple more years after that, divorcing around the time that I discovered the TF2 hat bazaars. [^1]

[^1]: They're both exceptional people who I appreciate so much. They obviously love me immensely, and I really appreciate their emotional support. I connect deeply with the relationship Flawless has with Trixi and Twixie, and I love how they're friends (or more) that she can turn to in hard times.

##

The more I discover about the fandom, the more I wonder about my current situation living with Kayla. I see these incredible love stories that look like pure beauty on the public outside. I honestly didn't even know that was possible. Kayla's wanted to get married as far back as I can remember, and honestly it makes me sick just thinking about that. Things changed a lot when she started working full-time. She lost the energy to keep at us. [^2]

[^2]: There are a lot of nuances here, and she's an amazing partner. I think I started asking more of her earlier this year when work intensified. As stress followed, she took on more of the cooking around the house which I just don't want to write about right now.

I used to get this warm feeling around her; even got hard at sight on her arrival to date nights. But that was a long time ago, and I'm trying to pick up the pieces to see what's left here to salvage. I plan to get some professional help locally.

### Separation

In thinking about whether I needed this creative relationship space, I reviewed how I could work through these feelings myself. I am dealing quite intimately with who I will become, and there isn't a ton of teaching I plan to do. I've been down that path before, and it's just not the best use of my time, especially in something like relationships.

I thought maybe it was too much to centrally track all the experiences I had here. That I could work through things on my own. And, to an extent, that's still what I'm doing. [^3]

[^3]: For instance, I haven't populated the community Discord link in the last post. There's still no way for you to contact me. And I've deprecated my old associated Discord user account.

### Shift

But I want to drop all that for now. The thing I've been most peeved about lately is that my relationship seems to detract directly from my working efforts. The harder I go in my days, the worse shit I get from her at night. That could be the determining straw, but again I will take some time to think about it more.

I used to like that attribute about her. It was a litmus test of how centralized I was becoming. Anytime I put too much in or became an unnecessary chokepoint or fulcrum, I could remain in her reaction to see where I went wrong.

But I'm approaching the end of my introductory period with the Foundation. And honestly that was what I needed most of this training for, especially now that I have the Commission on my side. I have to decide if I want to spend the rest of my life tiptoeing in bureaucracies rather than shooting into the heart of potential. I think I'll understand a lot more after I merge in 723. Things are looking really good on the Community Fund side. I'll wait for the chickens to hatch before counting in a more comprehensive review.

## Work

Anyway, I just had to write a post today because it was a huge politicking week. I achieved what I'd been working on for three weeks at the behest of a community introduction. [^4]

[^4]: The introduction was through a mention in a significant fxtwitter.com thread. I spent days typing out the reply, which was my last post under premium over the normal 240-character limit. I don't plan to renew premium because fuck your centralized social media ;)

### Response

At first, the response served as an inspiration for the community show that week. It was really fun shooting around with Truth, and I'm so excited to have them in the community.

I'm going to try avoiding the close friends in posts like these because that's not really what I'm trying to get at with the whole relationship politicking. This is another thing that's driven me away from Kayla.

I found all these amazing close work friends who accept me for who I am in every regard. And I tried to do the same for Kayla. But I was always filtering with the Asperger's masking.

Earlier this year when I stopped masking, things really deteriorated. It's become clear that my most raw form could be too much for her. I'm still living with that to see how she reacts as I continue my examination.

### Continued

I was closing out the working items in my agenda like normal when I reached out to the relevant introductory point. We have interacted a few times over the years, and I respect their technical competence. But they aren't super close, and I actually just cajoled them into joining the Discord actually.

This is closer to the kind of person who I need to apply my skills to at the start, making a good impression. But once I realized their analytical-ness, I knew we were both on the same page. This also came from explicit statements agreeing on the problems with tZERO.

That's why I closed things out with a brief message letting them know how I was walking away. I put a lot of work into the reply, but I know it could've been better. I was sick after the third day of trying to get it perfect, and so I just got fed up and sent it out.

Broadly, I am at the limit of my politicking efforts. I do plan to drop all acts in the coming future, and I think I'm starting that by coming out with a brony profile picture. I honestly just don't care anymore, and I have a big enough moat at work that I can fucking do it.

### Rep

But just as I was about to walk away from the Wall St assholes, [^5] which I think will just make my life a whole lot easier. After I laid out how everything would collapse to the regulators, I sort of stopped feeling the need to continue down that avenue. Fuck them, you know.

[^5]: I am trying to calm my language down around here. I want to be a little more peaceful on the daily, which means isolating and minimizing feelings for the middlemen of past. Anger is just too distracting.

## The Desire for Power

Imperfect as it was, Mark was awesome enough to reply to my comment with an exceptional leading question. When I shot back a dead-on answer, we finally got a direct meeting request from the CEO Alan. No matter what happens next, I win.

I can craft this narrative of public information. It's important in my mind to always take this cautious approach with adversaries, who I've found often stop at nothing including future alterations to public information. [^6]

[^6]: For instance, Reuters just censored two years of GME articles. They materially amended language related to SEC review. Take a wild guess at who prompted this change, boys.

### Update

However, upon checking my own source for this claim, I realized that we actually hit a straight-shot home run with this. It seems they replied within a couple of hours of my request for a meeting, publicly affirming a speaking appearance. This is literally a first-of-its-kind discussion at this scale criticizing a _very_ important topic in my industry. I have five days to prepare for what will be my introduction to the Executive Branch by means of Patrick Byrne. Honestly cannot overstate how important this is.

I'll spend the remainder of this post describing the means I used to achieve this result.

### Intentional Helplessness

I had a relatively intimidating `pilot` profile picture on X at the start of this engagement, where I was in the cockpit of an old bomber. I changed this to a naive headshot taken from when I was in high school. This paints me as a much younger, but still suit-and-tie professional in a calming blue light.

Colors matter a lot, and they are well established by commercial branding experts. I tend around black, blue, purple, and sometimes white.

The black is for my day-to-day, because it keeps the stress off my eyes staring at screens endlessly. But it also protects my daily life. Black is the safest color, and it avoids undue attention.

For someone like me that wants a low profile to avoid human interaction, black helps with that. It's a simple color to style around because you choose to have no creative output. For instance, it's the pupils alone in my OC, and indeed it is in my mind the antithesis of creativity. For when I need pure reliable stability, I turn to black.

Blue is peaceful. Used to calm enemies or calm myself. And it's by far the most trustful color I can approach the public with.

I used it a lot more when I was younger, teaching and introducing myself to the world. It's always what I planned to wear to testimony, and I keep it in mind in daily objects I need to trust. It colors my phone case, water bottles, and refill jugs while matching the color of water and life.

These last months, I've also come to interpret blue as a color of childhood youthfulness. As a boy, it was the major color known to the world through Sonic the Hedgehog. I see it more in my older, younger self and the childhood sentiments I carry in blue tint.

White is just for when things need to be clean for bureaucratic review. It's horrible on the eyes and incredibly easy to dirty, but when you need something that looks perfect for a one-off centralized review, white will serve you well.

Purple is where things get really interesting. My personal branding code is `#AC51FF`. I love it so, so much, because purple represents innovation and creating change.

It is by all means the color of revolution. The capture of passion. The mix of heart and pure ecstasy as you approach singularity.

Most of my creative drafting material locally uses a purple hue to keep me thinking for the future. I used to have my whole keyboard purple just to promote this concept, before changing the punctuation points to a faster typing method alongside a rainbow-dash-colored theme. [^7]

[^7]: Love the individual key RGB addressability of the Huntsman, even if their Windows software sucks. Or maybe it's the OS that's the problem. Gah I love the keyboard but hate the software lol!
