THe first post was pretty muh flawless, and that's efinately the dynamic I'm goin for here. Bt it was so much effort hat I really though t abut abandoing this whole project .  I have ery specific needs i nmy life that I've learned over years of trial and effrororr.

The msotformative time in my life was when  dsicovered marekts. They showed me a kind of freedom I couldn't imagine in my pre-teens. I wasn't shut out because of my age, and I could channel everythign through text chat (or voice-only, at worst) in a way that just let me be another eer participant on the same playing field as everyone else.

To say thigns were n a tight liock is an undertatmenet, and it was evident in the strinctness within my parents' relationship. They only made it a couple more years after that, divorcing around the time that I discorered the TF2 hat bazaar.s [^1]

[^1]: They're both excpetional people who I appreicate so much. They bviosily love me immensely, and I ealyappreciate their emotional support.  I connet deeply wiht hte relationship Flalwless has wto Trwi and Twixie, and I love how they're friends (or more) that she can turn to in had times.

Kayla's wanted t oget married as far back as I can remember, and honestlyl it makes me sick just thinkign about that. Things changed a lot when she started working fulltime. She lost the energ to ep at
