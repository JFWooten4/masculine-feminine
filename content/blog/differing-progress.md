THe first post was pretty muh flawless, and that's efinately the dynamic I'm goin for here. Bt it was so much effort hat I really though t abut abandoing this whole project .  I have ery specific needs i nmy life that I've learned over years of trial and effrororr.

The msotformative time in my life was when  dsicovered marekts. They showed me a kind of freedom I couldn't imagine in my pre-teens. I wasn't shut out because of my age, and I could channel everythign through text chat (or voice-only, at worst) in a way that just let me be another eer participant on the same playing field as everyone else.

Tha was so special to me, becuase I grew p in a very centralized and hierarchal household. My Dad made a million dollars in 2008, working at one of the bailed-out bandks. To say thigns were n a tight liock is an undertatmenet, and it was evident in the strinctness within my parents' relationship. They only made it a couple more years after that, divorcing around the time that I discorered the TF2 hat bazaar.s [^1]

[^1]: They're both excpetional people who I appreicate so much. They bviosily love me immensely, and I ealyappreciate their emotional support.  I connet deeply wiht hte relationship Flalwless has wto Trwi and Twixie, and I love how they're friends (or more) that she can turn to in had times.

##

Te more I dsiover about the fandom, the more I woner about my current situation living with Kayla. I see these incredible love stories that look like pure beautry on the publi outside. I honestly didn't even know that was possible.
Kayla's wanted t oget married as far back as I can remember, and honestlyl it makes me sick just thinkign about that. Things changed a lot when she started working fulltime. She lost the energ to ep at us.[^1]

[^1]: There are a lot of nuances here, and she's an amazing partner. I hink I started asking more of her earlier this year when work intensified. As stress followed, she took on more of the cooking around the house  hwich i just dont' want to write about rn

I use to et this wam feelign around her; even got hard at sight on her arrival to date nights. But that was a long time ago, and I'm trying to pick up the pieces to see what's left here to salvage. I plan to get some professional help loally.

### speerateion

In thinign abotu whether I needed this creative relaionship space, I reviewed how I could work through these feeligns myself. I am dealing quite intimately with who I will become, and there isn't a on of teching I plan to do . Ive been down that path before, and it's just not the best use of m time, especially in something like realtionships.

I thout mayb it was too cuh to entrally track all the experiences I had here. That I could work through thins on my own. And , to an extend, that's still wh I'm doing.[^1]

[^1]: For instnac,e I hvne't pupopualted the communty discord ink in the last post. Tere's stil n way for you to contact me. And I've eprecated my old assoiated Dsicord user accoutn.


### shift

But I want to drop all that for now. The hing I've been most peeved about lately is that my relationshhip seems to detract directly from my working efforts. The harder I go in my days, the worse shit I get from her at night. That could be the determining straw, but again I will take some time ot think about itmore.

I usd to lke that attribute about her. It was a litmus test of how centralized I was becoming. Anyime I put too much in or becausem an unnecesasyr chopoint or fulcrum, I couldn emain e her reacion to see where I went wrong.

But I'm approaching the end of my introdcutory period owith the FOundation. An honeslty that was what I needed most of this trainign for, especially now that I have the COmmmission on my side. I hve to devide if I wat to spend the rest of my life tipting in beurocraciesrather than shooting into the heart of portenial
I think I''ll understand a lt more after I erge in 723. Things are lookign really good on the Comunity Fund side. I'll wait for the chickens to hatch before counting in a mre comprehensive review.

## Work
Anyway, I just ahd to write a post today beuase it wa a huge politcking week. I chieed what I'd been wokring on for thee weeks at hte behest of a communtiy intrducion. [^1]

[^1]: THe introduction was through a mention in a siginficant X thread. I spent days typing out the reply, which was my last post under premium over the normal 240 character limit. I don't plan to renew premium becuase fuck your entralied soial media ;)

### resp

At first, the rsponse served as an inspiation for the ommunity show tat wek. t was really fun shooting aorund with Truth, and I'm so excited to have them in the ocmmuntiy.

i'm going to try avoiding the cloe friends in posts like these, because that's not really what I'm tryin to get at with the whole relationship politcking. This is another thing that's riven me away from Kayla.

I found all these amazing lcose work friends who accept me for who I am in ever regaurd. And I tried to do the same for Kayla. But I was lawyas filtering with teh Aspergers masking.

Ealier this year when I stopped masking, thigns really deteriorated. It's become clear that my most raw form could be too much for her. I'm still living with that ti o see how she reats as I continue my examination.


### cont'd

I was closing iout the working items in my agenda like nromal when I reched out to the relevant introducotry point. We have interacted a few times over hte years, and I respect their technical copetance. But they aren't super close, and I actualyl just cajoled them into joining the Discoord actually.

This is closer to the kind of perosn who I need to apply my skills to at the start, making a good impression. But once I realized their anayticall ness, I knew we were both on the same page. This also came from epxlct statements agreeing on the problem s with tZERO.

That's why I losed things out with a brief message letting them know how I was wlakign away. I put a lot of wokr into hte rpely, bu I know it oul'v been better. I was sick after the third day of trying to get it perfet, andso I just got fed up and sent it out.

Broadly, i am at the limit of my politcking efforts. I do plan to drop all acts in the coming future, and I think I'm startinghta mycoiming out with a brony profile picture. I hoenslty just on't care anymore, adn I have a big anough moat at work that I can fkn doinit.


### rep

But just as I was about to wlak away from the Wall St assholes, [^1]

[^1]: I am trying to cal m my languageodwn around here. I want to bew  al eittle more peaeful on thne daily, which menas isolating and minimizing yeeligns for the middlemen of past. Anger is just oo distracting


(contiuing sentnece) -- which I think iwll jsut make my lifea hwole lot easier. After i laid out how veryhting out collapse to the regualtors, I sort of sotpped feeling the ened to conitue down that avenue. Fuck em, ya know.

## The Desire for Power

Impefet as it as, Mark was awesome enough to reply to my comment with an excpetional leading question. When i shot back a dead-on answer, we finally goa direct meeting reuest from the CEO alan . No matter what happens next, I win.

I can craft this narrative of public infomation . It's important in my mind to alwyas take this autious approach ith adveraries, who I've foudn often stop ay nothing includin future alterations to public information.[^1]

[^1]: For intnace, Reutorers just censored tow years of GME articles. They mateirally amended languaged related to SEC review. Take a wild guess at who prompted this change boys.

### update

However, upon cheking my own source for this claim, I realized that we atually hoit a straight0shot home run with this. It seems they replied within a couple hours of my request for a meetingopublickly affirming a spekaign appreance. This is literalyl a first-of-oits-kind discussion at this cslare critizing a _very_ important topic in my industry. I have five days to prepare for what will be my introduction to the Executive branch by means of Patrick Bryne. Honeslty cannto overstate how important this is. 

I'll spend the remainder of this post descibing the mens I used to achive this resutl.

### inentional helpenssness

I had a relatively intimidating `pilot` profile pucture on X at the start of this enagnement, where I was in the cockput of an old bomber. I changed this to a naive headshot takedn form when I was in high school. This paints me as a much younger, but still suit-and-stie, professional in a clambing blue light.

COlros matter a lot, and they are well esteblushed mby commnrical braidnign experts. I tend around black, blue, purpole, and sometimes white.

The black is for my day-to-day, ebcuase it keeps the stress of my eyes starting at screens endlessly. But it alos protects my daly life. Balck is the safest color, and it avoids undue attention. 

For soemone like me that wants a low prfile to avoid human interaction balck helps with that. It's a simple olro to style around beause you chose to have no creative output. For isntnace, it's the pupils alone in my OC, an indeed it is in mymind the antithesis of reativity. For when I need pure reliable stability, I turn to black.

Blue is peaceful. Used to calm enemies or calm mysle.f Nd it's by far the most trustful color I can approach t public woiht.

I used it a lot more when I was younger, teaching and introduing myself to the worl. It's always what I planned to wear to tstimony, and I keep it in myind in daily objects I nedto trust. It colors my phone case, water bottles, and refill jugs while matchign the olor or water and life.

These last months, I've also om to itnerpet blue as   color of childhood youthfullnes. As a boy, it was the major color known to the world through sonic the hedhog. I see it more in my older , younger self and the childhood sentients I cary in blue tint.

White is just for when things need to be clean for beurocratic reivew. It's horrible on the eyes and increibly easy to dirty. but when you need something that looks perfect for a one-off centrlaized review, white will serve you well.

Puple is where things get really interesting. My personal branding code is `#AC51FF`. I love it so so much, ebcause purple repesensts innovation and creating hcange.

It is by all means the color of revolution. The capture of passion. The mix of heart and pure ecxtacy as you approach  singularity.

Most of my creative drafting amerialy locally use a purple hue to keep me thikign for the future. I used to have my whole keyboard purple jsut to promote this concept, before changing the ctuatation poitns to a faster typing method alongside a rainbow-dash colored theme. [^1]

[^1]: Love hte indiviual kaey RGB addressability of th hunstman, even if their windows sotware sucks, Or maybe it's the OS that's tha problem. Gah I loe th keyboard but hae the softwre lol!

Hah I used to tell Kayla lal baout how i wnt her o go blone, an he ooked bsilutely stunning whn she did. Gold is defiantely alnoher color or the accent signanlling the best. That is until I bust in mwith mypalladium.

It's a hufe I use sparingly, but I try to avoid the hubris of being he ost important person in the room. I do a whole lot better lurkign around in the corners until I have a uniqu opporuntiy to achieve my bjectives.

So, I did a few thins to make sure an indiial read o my profile would calm own any managmeent rewivew. Th
