FOr a very long time, I've erxccluisively done what was politically expediatn. I spent huge portions of my life crafting and maintaining honest narratives so that others had the easiest possible time coming  to my ends. FOr j usit about fiver  years now,  I've placed much of that central atenion on my Fiance Kayla, which has been exchausting.

This post   omes after two  of  my normal free-markets macros, and I've been thiknking about it for years in physcial journals. A moment of inspiration came when I made this X post.[^1] Vylet's really helped me process unheard emotions over the years, showing me that it's okay to lkiive outsidde  the norms imposed by entranched political mantras.

[^1]: Muhc of these relational politcking  developments seem to cement on  X, so  I'll start including more embeds for this work. IT's easy enough  to refrence, and worthwhile  too  given  the difficulty of scrolling back  to historic archives. Kayl;a doedsn't  use X
