FOr a very long time, I've erxccluisively done what was politically expediatn. I spent huge portions of my life crafting and maintaining honest narratives so that others had the easiest possible time coming  to my ends. FOr j usit about fiver  years now,  I've placed much of that central atenion on my Fiance Kayla, which has been exchausting.

This post   omes after two  of  my normal free-markets macros, and I've been thiknking about it for years in physcial journals. A moment of inspiration came when I made this X post.[^1] Vylet's really helped me process unheard emotions over the years, showing me that it's okay to lkiive outsidde  the norms imposed by entranched political mantras.

SHe might never know it, but I was the one who applied to monsdatercat on her bahlf after Antonymph. It felt realyl cool  to hear her say she didn't want to be part  of the  group in a subsequent post, and I loved the throwback to their graphics style  she  included in _My Love is a Quickscope_ at 3:44.[^2] That was really  the point I started seriosuly exploringmy influeince on artists.

## Trans Girls' Direct Support

This yl;ast year has been very rough as my relationship with Kayla went into despair. I took on a lot of extra stress pushing  myself to  manage her money, which lead to two  significant devastations.[^3]  It  culminated in my [rescinsion from markets](https://github.com/JFWooten4/free-markets/blob/main/micro/2025/Jun/24.md),  which was relatively encesary form an inseider t-trading point-of-view.[^4]

THat call has freed me up to focus excileively on wokr,  where I aimmediately started giving it my all/. However, the  very next month, I found myself glued  to a screen texting an incredible emmerging-trans (not to jinx them) aqrtist from Canada. We'd met after theri remoix of BGM's great take on Cupcakes

life partner things as dec,


post-style iwth notes:

When w estarted dating, I was too sared to go ater hat I really ewant

Chose her to heal the wounds of living a constantn lie to myself

Obvuous centralization v. integrity / authenicity

# X release commens as applicable

basically settled for  girl with no (foundig) missions / goals

[^1]: Muhc of these relational politcking  developments seem to cement on  X, so  I'll start including more embeds for this work. IT's easy enough  to refrence, and worthwhile  too  given  the difficulty of scrolling back  to historic archives. Kayl;a doedsn't  use X

[^2]: I also asked her about this directly on a livestream with about za dozne viewers, because I would've thought singing to  a label would be every artists's dream. She prudently ignored  my question, showcasing  how personal expression and artistic independence  in all forums ruled above direct populatgirt.y I think that's so fucking awesome, and watching  that mindset  develop across artists' fandom work really showed me the power o f decentralized self-acssociation and indepoednent efforts./  

[^3]: These are the  COinbase and FIdfelityh stoires which wil lmmake their way into SEC comments, the  former valued at approximatel $100k in missed profit.  IN b  oth cases,  the fiat processing  time disctated  by  interla middlemn policies ruined a trade. UNforutnastley, setup wroks taikes the stame stressful toll whether or not you actually execute orders.

[^4]: This was also politlcaly  motivatged, compelde in the middst  of our first review by the SEC as a personal show of good faith in the midthst of intense scruitynu. I've thought about it for a long time because of the public companies we'll take  on,  and I earnestly picked persuing the mission over my own jopys through managing financia l assets. L:ife has gotten signfiicantly easier since then, but it's oppened a whole that showed me just how much stress emmerged from interactions with Kayla at  home.
