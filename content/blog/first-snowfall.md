FOr a very long time, I've erxccluisively done what was politically expediatn. I spent huge portions of my life crafting and maintaining honest narratives so that others had the easiest possible time coming  to my ends. FOr j usit about fiver  years now,  I've placed much of that central atenion on my Fiance Kayla, which has been exchausting.

This post   omes after two  of  my normal free-markets macros, and I've been thiknking about it for years in physcial journals. A moment of inspiration came when I made this X post.[^1] Vylet's really helped me process unheard emotions over the years, showing me that it's okay to lkiive outsidde  the norms imposed by entranched political mantras.

SHe might never know it, but I was the one who applied to monsdatercat on her bahlf after Antonymph. It felt realyl cool  to hear her say she didn't want to be part  of the  group in a subsequent post, and I loved the throwback to their graphics style  she  included in _My Love is a Quickscope_ at 3:44.[^2] That was really  the point I started seriosuly exploringmy influeince on artists.

## Trans Girls' Direct Support

This yl;ast year has been very rough as my relationship with Kayla went into despair. I took on a lot of extra stress pushing  myself to  manage her money, which lead to two  significant devastations.[^3]  It  culminated in my [rescinsion from markets](https://github.com/JFWooten4/free-markets/blob/main/micro/2025/Jun/24.md),  which was relatively encesary form an inseider t-trading point-of-view.[^4]

THat call has freed me up to focus excileively on wokr,  where I aimmediately started giving it my all/. However, the  very next month, I found myself glued  to a screen texting an incredible emmerging-trans (not to jinx them) aqrtist from Canada. We'd met after theri remoix of BGM's great take on Cupcakes 

I needed that time to recover from a week of nonstop rtergualroy drafting that used cafene and adrenaline to formulatge very complex roadmap items for the SYdniccate. I disucuss  this more in a Macros reflection and how it almsot lead to [physcial danger](https://github.com/JFWooten4/free-markets/blob/main/macro/2025-Oct-8.md#crash).  Ul;tiematley,  I just have not found the support that I need tyo revitalize myh masculane abilities quickly.

### Fall into Brony Music

This left  me with a coulpe femanine avenues that  fdilled my tank upj.[^5] ANd poyn songs on a renewed elvel really helkped me in my darkest times. Kayla's unchangable work schedule leaves her gone from 2-11pm wehen I mostg need femanine comfort, buut htat doesn't matter when songs are asycnhronus!

I listened  to a lot , and it really helped cement personality trraits I've had and must now explout to acomplish  my leadership requiremnts.[^6]  MLP alwyas helped so much when I couldn't figure things o ut growing up. And, more imporatnyl, it gave me  a digital family to smile with when I could find iddsparete online groups.

NOtwistanding relatively few fandom friends, the art through music (and  to a letsser extent drawings) become commonplace in the worlds I epxlored,  so  it was like I always had a support network.[^7] EUntprenruship is exceptionalyl lonely, even now, so I can'tr express how important that was to me. And the quality of new pony music is really jawdropping, plus it  just  keeps on  coming out!


### Capital  ALlocation  and Animations

DUring this time, I also dicoered [Tamers](https://x.com/TheTamers12345)  and LFØ's [Flower](https://youtu.be/DkUEHMfQw-I).  SDurely it's been discussed before, but I wanted to link for clarity of discovery. There's a p[part of me that wants to run away  from all the perfected polpitcking and presernt my innormost quirks to the world through my work, and I believe this transprency helps start that  vulenrabiilty.

In both  aases, a single person created unbelievable art , one with MS Paint 
and t he other basded on a decade of intern epxerience at studios like Dreamworks. They're both incredible exmaples of this growing trend these land years for poeple to just make whatever they wnat without asking studios for mpermission, which led to excpetional hits like the Glitch and Vivziepop.[^8] These and so many opthers showed me what people can do when they stick  to their goals, which really refheshed my  personal beliefg in human engienuits and ethe efficncy of markets to alter reward.

Again,  most o f this discover came during the stressful SEC period where Kayula  crucially  stoppepd both accting cutely (discussed) and actualyl ahving compelte fdaith in me. A little letter seh wrote expressed  how her faith was wavering, a belief I used from the first year of Block Transfer as gfas fueling my brain's engine. For so many years I was codependent on her hope in my  success, so I needed to replace it quickly with soemthign self-dustainable—which came through these realizations.

###  Trading and Life Path

Before my next reflections this month, I'll be the rfirst to admit I could've been better to her in many ways, but I promise that I did sincerely give it everythign I had after pouring into work for so long. IO've found that there's a point where you can tenmporariyl force thigns into bplace, but it's not sustainable or particualrly healthy .[^9] That  siad, 

-  trading view
-  
-  

- focus on work
- poliotcal



- very real








life partner things as dec,


post-style iwth notes:

When w estarted dating, I was too sared to go ater hat I really ewant

Chose her to heal the wounds of living a constantn lie to myself

Obvuous centralization v. integrity / authenicity

# X release commens as applicable

basically settled for  girl with no (foundig) missions / goals

[^1]: Muhc of these relational politcking  developments seem to cement on  X, so  I'll start including more embeds for this work. IT's easy enough  to refrence, and worthwhile  too  given  the difficulty of scrolling back  to historic archives. Kayl;a doedsn't  use X

[^2]: I also asked her about this directly on a livestream with about za dozne viewers, because I would've thought singing to  a label would be every artists's dream. She prudently ignored  my question, showcasing  how personal expression and artistic independence  in all forums ruled above direct populatgirt.y I think that's so fucking awesome, and watching  that mindset  develop across artists' fandom work really showed me the power o f decentralized self-acssociation and indepoednent efforts./  

[^3]: These are the  COinbase and FIdfelityh stoires which wil lmmake their way into SEC comments, the  former valued at approximatel $100k in missed profit.  IN b  oth cases,  the fiat processing  time disctated  by  interla middlemn policies ruined a trade. UNforutnastley, setup wroks taikes the stame stressful toll whether or not you actually execute orders.

[^4]: This was also politlcaly  motivatged, compelde in the middst  of our first review by the SEC as a personal show of good faith in the midthst of intense scruitynu. I've thought about it for a long time because of the public companies we'll take  on,  and I earnestly picked persuing the mission over my own jopys through managing financia l assets. L:ife has gotten signfiicantly easier since then, but it's oppened a whole that showed me just how much stress emmerged from interactions with Kayla at  home.

[^5]: As for Kayla's; defficeincceis, I think she's been on a path towards masculinity since she started working a job with her degree. She  is sort of lazy and dislikes hard work, which iI though would be OK since I could just become super rich. But it's taken more time and I've relized that I might want someonw who's actualyl happy to particpate in the race of deadly stakes I run with DTCC>.

[^6]: I've noticed myself using a lot more explessive adverbs latyely,  especially "really""
 or 
 honestly." I Think this i s the first itme in a long time that I've been so close with myh emotions, ppushign me towrads radical openess about my inner thoughts. All my work freflects the dfevleoping personality within me, as shown for instnace by my making this pository public  while drafting.

[^7]: I have gotten more into enjoying drawings latley as I needed quick pick-me-ups from immensely cute and femneine feed images. In the thick  of things, I used the music becuase it kept me going hwen I needed to write into the night  to meet staff deadlines.  

[^8]: While both of those are much more centralized, it's been simialrly excited watching them grow form nothing. ANd ofc  they asked Gabriel to be ALastor's singing voice before the  corp;orate takeover, exmeplifying the teamwork-first approach, which you lose in the conglomerate. I cna only imagine and want deeply to help faciliatetg a future where they receive direct financial response from free audience tipping

[^9]: I really  saw this in high-scchool science, where I had to put in much more effort than nromal to excel ion tests asnd eventualyl the AP Exam. Despiute the teacher gifting me a prep book which I duily studied, I got one mark lower than needed  to avoid studying all the same materials agian in college/. After getting detention for trading stocks in calss, I releized that some thigns werent weorth the efoort
