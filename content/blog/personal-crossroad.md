I _finally_ got referencable recognition by Trimbath in regard to the tZERO line of questioning. I also have an ironclad irrefutable public statement from their executive team (at least on the marketing front) referring to their outreach. This matters, but isn't the focus here, because I replied duly within the turnaround time for our chats, and they failed to even acknowledge that interaction in their erroneous statement of no contact.

6days continued into the Trimbath remarks by roping their CEO back in, who blundered in not showing up to a public commitment for discussion. That was a nice cherry on top of bringing Trimbath into the loop. I've come to terms with my own timeline and personality, in the sense that I didn't particularly prepare anything for impression on Trimbath, namely because I already had three interactions with her which introduced my profile.

I know it worked well because she explicitly tagged my account in discourse, but there was another important setup point in those prior communications. I started sponsoring her Ko-Fi for the same $10/mo I do on other centralized platforms. She posted a quick thanks after referencing the URL for a postcard I wrote here back in 2022.

It just felt really good to finally cross the bar on that relationship, and I've appreciated these last years of recognizing the permanence of connections. Nothing too crazy or new to report on today, but I am coming back to use this place as an output medium for when the relationships just become too much. While the site started from a pink feminine frame, I will now need to update it back to darkness for the background because I've abandoned the preliminary Discord profile first referenced with feminine mystique.

I did like that background from penetration, because being feminine in certain ways acutely does feel very good. But it's not a responsible use of my assets or ability. I'll also get a chance to test all this out in Ciderfest at the end of the month, which I cannot express how excited I am to finally have a resource output to get to baseline.

I think something clicked in me with the extremity of the review process, which I hope to avoid in the future. I want my sanity and conscious clarity more than speed or perfection. Everything's set up in my life, and I just appreciate a chance to keep it at the pace and means I define.
