I _finally_ got referncable regcongition  by Trimbath in re the TZERO likne of questioning. I halso have na ironclad ireftable puiblic statgmeenet  from their exective team (at least on marketing front) reffering to thier outreach. THis matter, but isn't the focus here, ebcause I replied duly within the turnaround time for our  chats, and they failed to even accknoledge that interation in their erronieous statement of no contact.

6days continued into the  Timbath rema
rks byn roping thier CEO back i un, whoi blunderfed in not showing up to  a p ublic ommitmtnet for disucssion. That was a nice cherry on top of bringin Trimbath into the loop. I've come to rterms with my owhn timeline and personality, in the sense that I dind't particialyl prepare anything  for impression on Trimbath, namelky befcauser I already had three ihnteractions with her which introduced my porofile.

I kjnow it worked well ebcause she explicilt ytagged my account in  discourse,  but there was another important setup point in those  prior comms. I started  sponsoreing her Ko-Fi for the saem $R10/mo I do on other centralizedc platforms. She posted  a quick thanks after refrencing the URL for aa postcard I wroter here back iun 2022.

It j ust  felty really gfood to finally cross the bar on that relationship, and i've appreciated these last yearss of recognizing the permmanance of connections. Nothing to crazy of new  to report on today,  but I am coming back top use this place as an output medium for when the relatiponshjips just become too m uch.  While the site started from a pink femananing frame, I will now need to update it back to  dfarkness  for the background because I've abandoned the preliminary Disdcord profile first refrenced with femananie mystique.

I did kllike that background from penetatraiton, because being femanannine in certain ways ccutely does feel very good. But it's not a reponsible use of  my assets or ability./ I'll alkso get a chance to test all this out ian Cidferfest tat the end of hte month w, which I canntot express how excited I am to finally hjave a resource output to get to basliene.

I think nsomething lcicked in mye with the extrmeeityh of the Review process, whcih I hope to avoid in the future. I want my sanity and consciouls cliarity more than speed or perfection. Everything's setup in my life, and I Just appreciate a chance to keep it at the pace and means I define.
